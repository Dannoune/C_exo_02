- **Add a pair of sneakers:** Users can add details of a pair of sneakers including the name, description, year, price, brand, size, and gender.

- **Display the sneakers array:** Users can view the list of sneakers stored in the `sneakers.txt` file.

- **Search sneakers by name:** Users can search for sneakers by providing a name and the program will display the matching sneakers from the stored list.

- **Quit the program:** Users can choose to exit the program gracefully.
