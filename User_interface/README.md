This program allows users to search for sneakers based on specific criteria, such as shoe size, gender, and brand. The program reads sneaker information from a text file and outputs the matching sneakers.

## Usage

1. Update the `file_path` variable in the code to specify the path to the `sneakers.txt` file.

2. Run the program using a Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python sneakers_search.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter your shoe size, gender, and brand.

4. The program will search for sneakers that match the specified criteria and display the results, including the name, description, year, price, brand, size, and gender of each matching sneaker.

## File Format

The program expects the sneaker information to be stored in a text file named `sneakers.txt`. The file should follow the following format for each sneaker:

```
Name: [Sneaker Name]
Description: [Sneaker Description]
Year: [Sneaker Year]
Price: [Sneaker Price] euro
Brand: [Sneaker Brand]
Size: [Sneaker Size]
Gender: [Sneaker Gender]
```

Each field should be on a separate line, and the values should follow the colon (`:`) after each field name.

## Example

Here's an example of the `sneakers.txt` file:

```
Name: Nike Air Max 90
Description: Classic sneaker with visible air cushioning.
Year: 1990
Price: 150.0 euro
